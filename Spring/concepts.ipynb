    "In Constructor Injection, dependencies are passed through the class constructor. This ensures that the dependency is set when the object is created and is best suited for mandatory dependencies.\n",

    "‚úÖ Ensures immutability (final fields can be used)\n",
    "‚úÖ Encourages clean code\n",

    "2. Setter Injection üõ†Ô∏è\n",
    "In Setter Injection, dependencies are set using setter methods. This is best for optional dependencies or when properties can be changed after object creation.\n",
