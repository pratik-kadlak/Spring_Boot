    "1. Constructor Injection üèóÔ∏è\n",
    "In Constructor Injection, dependencies are passed through the class constructor. This ensures that the dependency is set when the object is created and is best suited for mandatory dependencies.\n",
    "Advantages of Constructor Injection\n",
    "‚úÖ Best for mandatory dependencies\n",
    "‚úÖ Ensures immutability (final fields can be used)\n",
    "‚úÖ Encourages clean code\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Setter Injection üõ†Ô∏è\n",
    "In Setter Injection, dependencies are set using setter methods. This is best for optional dependencies or when properties can be changed after object creation.\n",
    "Advantages of Setter Injection\n",
    "‚úÖ Useful for optional dependencies\n",
    "‚úÖ Allows dependency modification after object creation\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages\n",
    "‚ùå More code required (extra setter methods)\n",
    "‚ùå Can lead to mutable objects\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Field Injection üîß\n",
    "In Field Injection, dependencies are injected directly into class fields using @Autowired. This is the simplest method but is not recommended for complex applications.\n",
    "Advantages of Field Injection\n",
    "‚úÖ Less boilerplate code\n",
    "‚úÖ Easy to implement\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages\n",
